THE LOS ANGELES CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR CONSIDERATION

SUBJECT: Sustainability and the Design and Construction of High Performance Schools

DATE NOTICED: 10/14/03 PRESENTED FOR ACTION: 10/28/03
PRESENTED BY: Mr. Lauritzen and MOVED/SECONDED BY: Ms.Korenstein/
Ms. Korenstein Mr. Lauritzen

MOTION: X RESOLUTION:

Whereas, Students are entitled to a safe and healthy school environment, and studies have indicated that
student achievement is greater and attendance higher when the learning environment is naturally lit,
comfortable and well maintained; .
Whereas, Schools should employ design and construction strategies that minimize operating costs,
including energy and water efficiency;

Whereas, As one of the largest property owners in Southern California, the Los Angeles Unified School
District has a large impact on the Los Angeles regional environment, including air quality through vehicle
use and power generation, and water through potable and irrigation uses and stormwater runoff into
creeks, rivers, and the Pacific Ocean;

Whereas, On February 13, 2001, the Board of Education unanimously adopted a motion supporting the
Blue Ribbon Citizens’ Committee recommendation to develop sustainable design criteria for the
construction of new and the expansion and renovation of existing District schools and campuses, and
directed the head of the Facilities Division, in consultation with the Director of Environmental Health and
Safety, to develop these criteria in consultation with the Collaborative for High Performance Schools
(CHPS);

Whereas, The Implementation Plan submitted by staff to the Board on May 15, 2001, presented strategies
for incorporating in all new construction and renovation projects, the six CHPS categories (site, water,
energy, materials, indoor environmental quality and district resolutions), and proposed requiring
certification by architects that their District projects have met or exceeded the minimum requirement for
CHPS certification;

Whereas, Over 80 District new school and school addition projects have been rated against the CHPS
criteria and found to be in substantial conformance, and the Facilities Division is working to incorporate
additional CHPS criteria as standard practice in all District construction projects with the goal of ensuring
that every project qualifies as a CHPS school; and

Whereas, The District continues to be supported in this effort by the District High Performance Schools
Working Group, whose members represent Federal and State agencies, local utilities, and other interested
parties; now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles recognizes the work of the Facilities
Division and the Office of Environmental Health & Safety to incorporate CHPS criteria into the
District’s school construction program, and commends the District’s architects for their efforts in
meeting the CHPS criteria; and
 
SUBJECT: Sustainability and the Design and Construction of High Performance Schools (continued)

Resolved further, That the Board directs staff to continue its effort to ensure that every District new
school and modernization project, from the beginning of the design process, incorporate CHPS criteria to
the extent feasible; that the next round of new schools minimally meet the CHPS qualifying level (28
points) and preferably achieve at least 32 points; and that the focus be on criteria in the following priority

areas:

a. Student performance and staff health and well being, through measures such as daylighting, use

of nontoxic-emitting materials, and sound insulation or isolation to minimize noise and enhance
acoustical quality in the classroom;

Operating cost minimization, through energy and water efficiency; and
Minimizing the impact of District operations on the environment, through, for example, the

installation or purchase of renewable energy resources such as solar power, and maximizing the
beneficial use of stormwater runoff: and , ee

Resolved further, That the Board endorses District participation in and directs staff to pursue partnerships
that further the goal of high performance schools, including Federal, State and utility programs that
provide sustainable design financial incentives, specifically:

a. The Los Angeles Sustainable Collaborative, whose goal is to further the adoption of sustainable

design in the region and whose other members are agencies that have also adopted sustainable
design requirements, including the City of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Community College
District, and the City of Santa Monica;

. The City of Los Angeles Integrated Resources Plan and the County of Los Angeles Watershed

Management Division, whose goal is to encourage the efficient use of water resources; and

c. The utility-sponsored Savings by Design Program; and be it finally

Resolved, That the Board directs staff to report to the Board annually on the progress of this program,
and provide quarterly summary statistics on: the number of new schools and modernization projects
designed and the percentage which have incorporated CHPS design criteria, and other statistics useful in
assessing the progress of this effort.

",1,Update to Rubbish and Recycling Services Program (note: this is not the templated BP),"PURPOSE: MAJOR CHANGES: The purpose of this Memorandum is to provide information to schools and other support facilities regarding upcoming changes to the District’s rubbish collection and recycling programs. Effective immediately, the District has contracted with a new rubbish vendor. GUIDELINES: The following guidelines apply. In December 2011, LAUSD awarded a District-wide rubbish collection and recycling services contract to Consolidated Disposal Service, LLC, which is a subsidiary of Republic Services, Inc.  Under the direction of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS), this contract will provide support to the District in an effort to divert more of its waste stream from landfills by: 1) launching a renewed effort to increase recycling throughout the District; and 2) introducing composting programs at select schools.  Starting in late January 2012, a Recycling Outreach Team will be visiting schools and other District facilities to discuss their current rubbish service and the opportunity to increase recycling in the classrooms, staff offices, cafeterias, operations facilities and Local District offices. The benefits of participating in this free program include: • Shifting 20% of trash to recyclables as per LAUSD mandate; • Complying with a LAUSD Board of Education Resolution on Waste Reduction and Recycling, which was adopted in December 2003; • Reducing the environmental footprint of each facility; and • Being part of this District-wide recycling effort! Schools and other District sites can expect the following as part of this program: • New contact information to answer concerns and issues regarding rubbish and recycling pick-ups (bins, scheduling, etc.) -- the new telephone number for bin requests, service, and information is:  (213) 241-3955, or fax documents to (213) 241-6821 . • Optimization of the number of rubbish and recycling bins present on site; and • Website access through OEHS for better customer service. There is NO action required of site staff to initiate this program, and there will be NO disruption in school calendars or of rubbish collection during the transition period. The Recycling Outreach Team looks forward to meeting with site representatives in the next few weeks regarding your rubbish pick-up and recycling service, and thanks you in advance for your efforts to help the District achieve a more environmentally sustainable position within our communities.",0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,1,Climate Literacy Resolution (note: this is not the templated BP),"Board of Education Report 333 South Beaudry Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90017 File #: Res-016-21/22, Version: 2 Mr. Schmerelson, Dr. McKenna, Ms. Goldberg - Climate Literacy (Res-016-21/22) (Noticed January 25, 2022) Whereas, The students of Los Angeles Unified School District, a majority of which are children of color, suffer disproportionately from the mounting climate crises, especially those who live in L.A.’s neglected city centers, which are becoming more dangerously hot; Whereas, The pollutants from the freeways and refineries in our neighborhoods increase as the climate gets hotter, causing more students, parents, and teachers to get asthma, heart disease, and diabetes; Whereas, Droughtdeepens due to global warming, making our water supplies less certain and more polluted, becoming additional uncertainty for our students; Whereas, Pandemics like COVID-19, which have killed so many, will happen more frequently because we are destroying the natural habitats of plants and animals; Whereas, The increasing heatwaves, fires, downpours, and floods are due to burning fossil fuels, which continues despite humanity’s understanding, confronting students with increasingly unstable futures; Whereas, Students’ families, cultures, communities, and experiences, as well as their friendships, are resources to face these difficulties; Whereas, Students’ social and emotional health is supported by experiences in nature on schoolyards, parks, beaches, or trails; Whereas, Our students’ mental and emotional health must be supported by learning about the climate crises, thinking through solutions for themselves, and by taking part in climate solutions to be implemented in their surroundings; Whereas, Schools can teach these deep considerations since they are strategically placed as the “beating hearts of communities,” preparing students for the millions of jobs in the rapidly expanding green economy and for the work of realigning civilization to nature’s flows; Whereas, With proper support, all teachers can infuse climate themes into all subjects, well beyond STEM, all of which affect culture and governance; Whereas, Ongoing support and coordination are required at various levels to rapidly improve and increase climate teaching, especially because climate is highly related to equity, and both subjects are complex and emotionally and politically fraught; and Whereas, The District has monies from both federal and state government that are specifically directed at improving schools’ ability to address equity and climate in curricula, money that must be spent in 3 to 5 years; Los Angeles Unified School District Page 1 of 2 Printed on 2/4/2022 powered by Legistar™557 File #: Res-016-21/22, Version: 2 now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District commits to transforming our teaching of climate change to meet the scale and urgency of the crises by implementing, infusing, and developing climate change education across all curricula, and in every grade PK-12, a commitment that will require the allocation of significant resources; Resolved further, That the District will develop, streamline, and expand outdoor education with the goal of within three years having every student, every year, participate in an outdoor experience which includes climate literacy instruction; Resolved further, That the District will create a comprehensive, flexibly constituted, school- and communitybased Climate Literacy Curriculum Implementation Task Force to coordinate all these efforts, which meets quarterly and as needed, and meetings should include public input; Resolved further, That the District designate an overarching District’s Climate Literacy Curriculum Implementation Task Force will have working groups that will serve to convene and organize all other related working groups called for by previous initiatives and resolutions that will coordinate resources and support that are focused on allocated to school greening, gardening, outdoor education, and clean energy efforts and create a Districtwide effort that will include (i) staff development (including Schoology integration) using California climate curricula across all disciplines, (ii) curricula development where needed, especially for climate justice lessons, local issues, trauma-informed activities and (iii) streamlining and expanding outdoor education and school greening at the District level; and (iv) organization of a resource repository and its promotion through Schoology Climate Literacy groups, folders, and resources; Resolved further, That an existing staff member in at each Local District, Community of Schools, and in every school, be designated as a Climate Champion who will monitor how climate literacy is built into language acquisition, English language arts, math, science, history/social studies, health, and other core subject areas; and, be it finally Resolved, That the District commits to support staff creating and funding positions in to exploring future sources to fund positions in each Local District, Community of Schools, and every school to develop and implement the above programs. This resolution states that the District commits to transforming our teaching of climate change by implementing, infusing, and developing climate change education for grades P-12 across all curricula. It also states that the District create a comprehensive school and community-based Climate Literacy Implementation Task Force to coordinate all these efforts and have working groups that will coordinate resources allocated to school greening, gardening, outdoor education, and clean energy efforts.  The resolution also includes the funding of positions in each Local District, Community of Schools, and schools to support the program.   The budget impact cannot be quantified based on the current language in the Resolution. However, any recommendations from the Climate Literacy Task Force may have a budget implication.  In addition, any positions created to support this resolution will also have a budget impact. ",1,Earth Day Resolution 2000,"Whereas, The first Earth Day was celebrated back in 1970 and rallied over 20 million Americans from around the country; Whereas, Earth Day is a day of observation for Mother Earth and provides meaningful opportunities for celebration, education and action for people of all ages; Whereas, Earth Day will be celebrated on April 22, 2000, and on an annual basis; Whereas, Earth Day is an excellent opportunity to promote environmental education, for students grades K through 12; Whereas, Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District students have already participated in clean ups, and restoration and recycling projects; Whereas, Teachers and administrators will continue to participate in various training in order to prepare for the 2000 and future Earth Day activities; Whereas, The Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles recognizes the need to promote environmental awareness where students can benefit from the study of ways to protect our planet’s ecological balance; and Whereas, The Board of Education supported in 1999 Earth Day; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles declare Earth Day as an officially approved District day of observation now and hereafter; and be it SUBJECT:    Earth Day Resolved further, That the Superintendent or his designee be authorized to require appropriate instructional activities in all schools and offices and enter into appropriate arrangements with host organizations sponsoring events, after such arrangements are reviewed by the Division of Instruction.

1. Identifying and monitoring pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.

2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazards that would indicate corrective action should be taken.

3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.

4. Considering a full range of possible alternative cost-effective treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for the use of chemical control agents.

5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazardous effects to people and the environment.

6. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and label directions registered with the EPA as well as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.

The designated IPM coordinator shall prepare and regularly update a districtwide IPM plan based on the template provided by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR).

Integrated pest management means a strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment threshold levels, using nonchemical practices to make the habitat less conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Education Code 17609; Food and Agricultural Code 13181)

The IPM plan and this administrative regulation shall not apply to reduced-risk pesticides, including self-contained baits or traps, gels or pastes used for crack and crevice treatments, antimicrobials, and pesticides exempt from registration by law. (Education Code 17610.5; 3 CCR 6147)

The IPM coordinator shall not use any pesticide that is prohibited by DPR or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as listed on the DPR web site. (Education Code 17610.1)

Program Components

The district's program shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following components:

1. Identifying and monitoring pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.

2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazards that would indicate corrective action should be taken.

3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.

4. Considering a full range of possible alternative cost-effective treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for the use of chemical control agents.

5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazardous effects to people and the environment.

6. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and label directions registered with the EPA as well as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.

(cf. 3514 - Environmental Safety)

(cf. 3514.1 - Hazardous Substances)

7. Informing parents/guardians and employees regarding pesticide use as described in the sections ""Notifications"" and ""Warning Signs"" below.

8. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are sufficiently trained in the principles and practices of IPM.

(cf. 4231 - Staff Development)

The IPM coordinator and any employee or contractor who intends to apply a pesticide at a school site shall annually complete a DPR-approved training course on IPM and the safe use of pesticides in relation to the unique nature of school sites and children's health. (Education Code 17614; Food and Agricultural Code 13186.5)

PV Solar Energy Photovoltaic (PV) Overview • Solid State technology converting solar radiation into electricity • No moving parts • No fuel required • No pollutants over life cycle • Reliable source of power when sun is shining • Low maintenance • Proven technology from 1960‘s space program • New and constantly changing technology 26IV.  PV Solar Energy Types of PV Systems Crystalline Cells (most common) Monocrystalline silicon cell modules • 14% efficient • 12-14 W / square foot • More difficult to manufacture than poly, but uses less silicon Poloycrystalline silicon cell modules • 12% efficient • 10 W / square foot • Easier to manufacture than mono, but requires more silicon 27IV.  PV Solar Energy Types of PV Systems Thin-film Cells • Various types currently available: • Amorphous silicon • Copper indium diselenide (CIS) • Cadmium telluride (CdTe) • Gallium arsenide (GaAs) • Advantage is lower cost per watt than crystalline • Disadvantage is much more square footage required due to inefficiencies • 4-8% efficient • 3-6 W / square foot 28IV.  PV Solar Energy Types of Systems Thin-film Cells (cont.) New emerging technology • Copper indium galloum selenide (CIGS) • 19% efficient claimed • 10-12 W / square foot claimed 29IV.  PV Solar Energy Types of Systems Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) • Integration of PV cells into building components • Available with crystalline or thin film technology • Roofing (all types) • Equipment screens • Shade structures • Windows • Curtain walls • Skylights • Building facades 30IV.  PV Solar Energy Types of PV Systems Concentrating Collectors • Use of mirrors and/or lens to concentrate sun’s energy • Typically used in conjunction with tracking devices to optimize sun angle • Very efficient, but higher cost • Emerging and very promising new technologies: • Micro plastic reflectors produce similar efficiencies at much lower cost • Higher efficiency triple-junction cells • Heliotube panels use half-cylinder reflector panels 31IV.  PV Solar Energy Systems Components • Inverters: PV panels generate direct current (DC) and require conversion into 120/208 volt three phase alternating current (AC) power (weak link) • Batteries: Typically not used where self generated power can be sold back to utility provider • Tracking devices: Single and dual tracking devices rotate PV arrays to maximize efficiencies typically only used when other PV applications are not feasible 32IV.  PV Solar Energy Economic Analysis • Becoming more economically feasible: • Continuing advances in cell manufacturing and new technologies • Government and utility incentives • Rising electrical costs • Several factors contribute to the cost and payback analysis: • Type of PV cells and application of system • Size of system (economy of scale) • Rebates and incentives (constantly changing) • Electricity rates • Local market conditions (material and labor costs) 33IV.  PV Solar Energy Economic Analysis New versus Existing • Integration of PV on new construction projects is much more viable than retrofitting • Retrofitting panels on existing school roofs can be cost prohibitive due to DSA structural requirements • Warranty and replacement issues on existing roofing • Most urban school sites cannot afford to lose significant space necessary for ground-mounted PV - vandalism and theft concerns on school campuses • Most appropriate retrofit application for impacted urban sites is installation of new shade structure over paved areas – this adds significant costs to the installation 34IV.  PV Solar Energy Economic Analysis Example • 200-kW Polycrystalline Array - 20,000 square feet • Installed cost: $1,680,000 ($8.40/watt) • Potential utility rebates: $662,000 • Net installation cost: $1,018,000 • Average output: 262,850 (0.9 degradation factor) • Average utility rate of $0.14 /kWh (6.7% escalation) • Simple payback: 27.7 years (20-year life expected) (Source: LACCD Greenpaper by Glumac) 35IV.  PV Solar Energy Economic Analysis Summary • The cost to integrate PV into building components for new construction can reduce payback period to 16-20 years • PV systems do not make economic sense on their own • Even with significant utility incentives, simple payback period exceeds expected life of the system • Tax exempt entities cannot directly take advantage of the government incentives 36IV.  PV Solar Energy Financing Options District Procures System Directly • Advantages • All power generated is realized as direct savings • Reduction in General Fund expeditures • No future buy-out required • No long term agreements • Disadvantages • Requires significant capital outlay • Does not take advantage of current tax credits • Requires maintenance 37IV.  PV Solar Energy Third Party Financing Option • Advantages: • No upfront cost • Fixed energy cost for portion generated from PV installation • Guaranteed energy savings can be negotiated • Disadvantages: • Cost difference between market rate and negotiated fixed rates is not significant savings • Long term agreement (10-20 years) • Cost to buy out system at end of PPA • Estimated useful life of 20 years (6-7 years inverters) • Requires minimum of 25,000 square feet non-shaded area • Location can be problematic 38 • Damage, theft, and vandalismIV.  PV Solar Energy Summary • Solar energy is only one solution to achieve grid neutrality other alternatives also explored and considered • Solar combined with other solutions and systems may produce more benefits • Challenges and distinctions between new and existing schools – some sites and projects more suited to solar • Opportunities on new schools better than existing sites and buildings (ie New High School #1 – ECATS) • Evaluating and reviewing standards and design guidelines may develop performance standards for projects/sites 39IV.  Looking Into the Future • Emerging technology on all fronts of sustainability very exciting and promising: • Power conservation - fully integrated building automation systems, nanotechnology, higher efficiency HVAC and lighting systems, high performance building insulation, high performance glazing, power conditioning • Power generation - fuel cell technology, more efficient and less costly PV, microwind turbines • Technologies changing quickly • Uncertainties of incentives, policy changes, and deregulation impacts 40For More Information This Presentation (along with Board Workbook Materials) is available at: www.lbschools.net 41 "

They should be resilient in the face of future changes to our climate and operated in a way that does not contribute to those changes. That’s why SFUSD is embarking on a multidecade effort to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. The technology exists to construct buildings that use no more energy than they generate, and all new SFUSD buildings will be built to this standard. In existing buildings, we will gradually replace gas boilers with electric heat pumps. Instead of burning natural gas, our heat pumps will operate using clean, renewable electricity provided by the SF Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and by solar panels on our rooftops. Our goal is to achieve a 50% reduction in natural gas usage by 2030 and to stop burning it entirely by 2040. Thanks to past building modernizations, we are already well on our way to achieving these targets. In order to eliminate the use of gasoline and diesel in our vehicle fleet, SFUSD is mandating that all new cars be emissions free and that school buses switch to renewable diesel by 2020. By 2030, we plan to remove our final gaspowered vehicle from the fleet. CONTENTS Context 3 Utilities 5 Goals 7 Progress 8 Strategy          Funding 12         Facilities 13         Transportation 15 Conclusion 17  CONTEXT In 2008, with support from the San Francisco Public Utility Commission (SFPUC) and San Francisco Department of the Environment (SFE), San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) hired its first Director of Sustainability. By allowing the District to focus on the three core goals of managing utility costs, reducing waste, and promoting healthy and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation for the school commute, the creation of the Sustainability Office was a major step forward in aligning SFUSD with the environmental ambitions of the City of San Francisco.  Since the Office’s creation, managing utility usage and cost has become a top priority as the SFPUC has raised electricity and water rates in recent years and California’s drought demanded reductions in water consumption. In addition, the District recognizes its obligation to fight anthropogenic climate change as a member of the environmentally-progressive San Francisco city family. GHG Emissions FY 16: 16,800 mtCO2e Vehicle Fuels 29% Facility Energy 71% Because it benefits from carbon-free hydroelectric power, the District’s (Scope 1 & 2) climate footprint is dominated by the natural gas it uses to heat its buildings and fuels it uses to power its vehicles. That’s why the SFUSD Sustainability Office has developed this Zero Net Energy strategy for SFUSD buildings in consultation with the Bond, Buildings & Grounds, and Facilities Departments. Vehicle fuels make up about 30% of SFUSD’s greenhouse gas emissions. These include diesel fuel used in large school buses, gasoline used in smaller school buses, and gasoline used by District fleet vehicles. Efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels in SFUSD-affiliated vehicles are described at the end of this document. The City and County of San Francisco has a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2025 and 80% by 2050. In addition, the State of California has a legislated greenhouse gas reductions goal of 40% by 2030 (SB32) and an executive directive to reduce emissions 80% by 2050. As part of that goal, the State of California is mandating that all new commercial buildings, and half of existing buildings, be Zero Net Energy (ZNE) by 2030. This means that they should use no more energy over the course of a year as they generate through on-site renewable energy systems. Since the systems installed as part of the 2016 SFUSD facilities improvement bond will still be around in 2030, it is essential that the District prepare for future building requirements today. The Division of the State Architect (DSA) is eager to promote the achievement of these State targets and hosted an architecture competition to identify ways in which schools in a variety of CA climate zones could be upgraded to ZNE status. It has also launched a pair of ZNE school retrofit pilots to determine the feasibility of implementing deep energy reductions in California’s existing school building portfolio. In order to gain an insight into the products and processes needed to allow an existing building to meet ZNE status, SFUSD is taking part in the DSA pilot by retrofitting Garfield Elementary School on Telegraph hill to meet this ambitious target. SFUSD is also an implementing 3 partner, along with twelve (12) other school districts, in the Department of Energy's Zero Energy Schools Accelerator. The goal is to help districts nationwide to incorporate ZNE construction practices into their building projects. The market for zero energy buildings is taking off rapidly, in California as well as the rest of the country, and educational buildings make up the bulk of such projects. This is due to the fact that schools tend to have just a few stories and are therefore more easily powered by solar PV installed on their rooftops. In addition, since educational institutions generally own school buildings and utility bills make up the second biggest expense after salaries, school districts have a strong incentive to reduce utility bills even when projects have longer paybacks. Increasingly, however, ZNE schools are being constructed at no additional cost with respect to traditional construction. In addition, upgrades to the lighting and heating systems in modernized schools pay big dividends in terms of user comfort, educational performance of the students, and resilience in the face of a warming climate. Finally, schools take seriously their role as role models for the next generation of society and see opportunities to integrate zero energy buildings into the school curriculum.  4 UTILITIES The District spends just under $6 million per year on utility costs, a number that has not changed in several years. This low value is made possible by a special municipal utility rate and a bulk purchasing arrangement for natural gas. Changes in the rates of individual utilities have varied, however, such that natural gas no longer makes up the bulk of SFUSD utility costs.  Electricity Utility Costs By Type FY 15-17: Average $5.9M Water 30% Electricity 37% Natural Gas 33% The SPFUC provides the District with near carbon-free electricity generated by its Hetch Hetchy water system on a special municipal rate schedule without demand charges. Historically, this rate schedule has provided the District with below market rate electricity. For comparison, in 2008 the district was paying 3.75¢ per kWh compared to PG&E’s Electricity Rates $/kWh 0.10 0.08 0.05 0.03 0.00 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Natural Gas standard commercial rate of approximately 16¢ per kWh. This 75% cost difference has reduced the incentive to reduce electricity usage. Over the past 8 years, however, rates have increased as the SFPUC seeks to approach the cost of service for all of its municipal rate customers. In FY2017 and FY2018, electricity rates are set to increase by 7.5% and 6.9%, respectively. Rate increases being planned for subsequent years will ensure that electricity is the District’s largest utility cost in the next few years.  Natural Gas Rates $/therm PG&E, through an agreement with a bulk purchaser (SPURR), provides the district with natural gas services on a small commercial (G-NR1) rate schedule. Natural gas rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to market effects and the impact of the boom in shale gas production.  1.50 1.25 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 PG&E recently received approval from the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) to increase transmission charges for all its customers. For the district this is estimated to increase fixed transmission costs by 23%, or an additional $150,000 annually. In addition, natural gas as a fuel commodity has remained well below its 5 and 10 year averages. As supply dwindles, the District can anticipate that both transmission and supply costs will increase in the future.    5 Water The SFPUC provides water and sewer services on a standard W-1C commercial rate schedule. This schedule includes a fixed transportation charge for access to the water and sewer piping, based on the number and size of water meters, a volumetric charge for the amount of water consumed, and a mixture of sewer treatment charges that are established at a system-wide level.  Since 2008, both fixed and volumetric charges for water and sewer costs have increased approximately 12% annually to cover upgrades to the City’s sewer and water delivery systems and will continue to do so through FY 2018. Based on historical trends, the district can expect rates beyond FY 2018 to continue to increase and for a new stormwater charge to be implemented.  Water Rates $/CCF 20 15 10 0 5 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 6 GOALS The SFUSD School Board, via its Carbon Neutral Schools Resolution, is calling on the District to achieve the following targets as it seeks to phase out fossil fuel use by 2040: Buildings ● New buildings will be designed wherever possible with the goal of using no more energy than they could generate on site. ● New and modernized buildings will be plumbed for rainwater collection where feasible. ● SFUSD will strive to reduce gas usage 30% by 2020, 50% by 2030, and 100% by 2040. ● SFUSD will strive to reduce its water usage 30% by 2020 and 50% by 2030. Fleet ● All new SFUSD-owned vehicles shall be emissions-free. ● SFUSD will strive to fuel all diesel-powered buses with renewable diesel by 2020. ● All SFUSD-owned vehicles will be electric or powered by low-carbon fuels by 2030. Renewables ● SFUSD will strive to generate all of its own power on site by 2050. ● SFUSD will strive to meet 50% of water demand via rainwater by 2050. 7 PROGRESS Thanks to existing energy efficiency efforts and sustainable design choices during past modernization projects, SFUSD has made significant progress toward these goals since the Sustainability Office was founded. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) EUI measures the energy use of a building on a per-square-foot basis. This metric quickly captures the energy efficiency of a building stock and incorporates the impact of energy retrofits as well as the addition of renewable energy. The District’s long-term goal is to reduce the average EUI to 20 kBTU/sf/yr by 2040 since this value makes it possible to cover a 2-3 story building’s yearly energy usage entirely by roof-mounted solar panels. Energy Use Intensity The District’s EUI hovered around 45 kBTU/sf/yr for many years before the efforts of the sustainability office and the impact of a couple warm winters caused it to start dropping in 2012 and eventually reach 30 kBTU/sf/yr in 2015. This represents a reduction of 33% over our 2008 baseline across the entire SFUSD building stock. kBtu/sqft/year 50 40 30 20 10 2017: 35 Target: 20 0 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 2028 2032 2036 2040 Natural Gas The winter of 2016-2017 has been the coldest in recent memory, so an increase in the District’s energy usage is expected. Early indications suggest, however, that EUI will not rise nearly as much as heating degree days, a validation of the District’s energy efficiency strategy.  Since Hetch Hetchy power is 100% renewable, the District’s building carbon footprint is entirely the result of its natural gas usage. Thus, the goal of eliminating SFUSD’s carbon footprint by 2040 centers around efforts to reduce heating loads and electrifying building heating systems. That’s why it is particularly encouraging to note that gas usage has dropped by 42% over the past eight years, again due to energy efficiency efforts and milder weather.  Natural Gas Use therms 4,000,000 3,000,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 2017: ▼28% Target: ▼100%   0 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 2028 2032 2036 2040 8 Solar Electricity Use kWh 40,000,000 30,000,000 Because of its hydroelectric electricity supply, SFUSD has not been in a hurry to generate renewable energy on site. In addition, the District’s low electric rate has made solar power financially unattractive (see sidebar). As electric rates rise, however, the financial feasibility of procuring renewable energy will be investigated. Of particular interest is the possibility that the SFPUC will offer a feed-in tariff that pays clients for generating power and feeding it into the grid. This might dramatically change the cost-benefit calculation and drive large scale solar generation across the District.  20,000,000 10,000,000 Solar Generated 0 2008 2010 2012 2017: 1.0% 2014 2016 Despite the financial obstacles, SFUSD does host a number of solar PV systems thanks to mandates for the SFPUC to install renewable energy on public buildings. The first such system went up on Alvarado Elementary School in 2013 and was installed by staff at the City’s Department of Public Works. Later additions have been outsourced to private contractors. In total, SFUSD has generated 780,000 kWh of electricity and now covers 1.8% of its electricity use via rooftop PV systems.  Water Water usage has a minimal carbon footprint in San Francisco, where the water arrives from the Sierra Nevada mountain range via gravity. Preparation and treatment do require energy, however, and the ongoing water concerns of the State of California motivate the Sustainability Office to monitor water consumption along with energy-related metrics.  Thanks to diligent efforts to identify and fix leaks through interval data analysis, installation of high 9 Water Use efficiency fixtures as part of bond modernization and deferred maintenance work, the widespread installation of low-flow aerators, and a preference for turf fields over natural grass, the District has been able to reduce its water usage by 28% since 2008. The Sustainability Office expects that the continuation of existing efforts will eventually reduce water usage 30% by 2020.  Transportation CCF 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 2017: ▼29% 0 2008 2012 2016 Target: ▼50% 2020 2024 2028 Over 85% of SFUSD fuel use is attributable to school buses and less than 15% to District vehicles. The largest share of the latter is attributable to cars, vans, and truck operated by Maintenance & Operations. Fuel data prior to 2015 is not readily available; the District has been able to reduce its vehicle emissions by 4% since then. Vehicle Emissions mtCO2e 2016: 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 ▼4% 0 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 2027 2029 Reducing fuel usage, or switching to renewable fuels or electricity for District-owned vehicles, is only part of the puzzle. A significant amount of Scope 3 (indirect) greenhouse gas emissions results from the transportation of students to and from school. While these emissions are not under Target: ▼100% SFUSD’s control, it is in a position to reduce these emissions through education and behavior change. Through its participation in the SF Safe Routes to School program, the District hopes to encourage families to walk, bike, take transit, or carpool to school. Unfortunately, despite individual success stories, the number of students driving to school has remained constant for many years. Even the inclusion of neighborhood preference in the District’s assignment process did not lead to a reduction in the almost 50% of students that are driven to school.  While not covered in this document, plans to reduce the solo commute rate to below 30% as called for in the Equitable & Sustainable School Transportation resolution of December 2015 are in the works and include districtwide traffic safety and bicycle education, the roll-out of walking school buses at all school sites, online carpool apps, and a longer range effort to minimize the need for car trips via changes to the assignment process and after school offerings.   Solo Car Trips Index 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 2016: 48% 2011 2015 2019 2023 Target: 30% 2027 10 11 STRATEGY SFUSD has already made significant progress on its path to eliminating natural gas use in its buildings. Since all of this work is being done within existing budgets, a brief look at available funding sources is warranted. Funding Bond The 2016 Proposition A Bond will provide a total of $744 million worth of facility upgrades, including $100 million for IT infrastructure, $20 million for Student Nutrition Services, $5 million for green schoolyards, and $5 million for sustainability projects.  While the amount set aside for sustainability is small, many of the building improvements discussed below will actually be incorporated into each project’s general construction budget. Instead, sustainability funding will cover: ● Creation of controls and commissioning specifications that align with the Carbon Neutral Schools policy ● Development of ZNE assessments to guide design decision in modernization projects ● Scope that is generally not included during bond modernizations but called out for in the ZNE assessments Facilities In general, SFUSD spends about $3 million per year on deferred maintenance projects and up to $10 million in developer fees. Where these funds support projects that have an impact on utility usage, they can be leveraged to improve the District’s energy performance. For example, insulation can be added to roofing projects or high performance glazing specified during a window replacement. By coordinating its efforts with the Sustainability Office, the Facilities Department is therefore able to support the District’s ZNE goals.  Proposition 39 SFUSD is slated to receive a total of $12 million from the State of California to implement energy efficiency improvements in its K-12 schools. The funding is intended for projects with a relatively short payback but can be used for deeper energy retrofits if other sources of funding (such as bond funds) are leveraged to offset total project costs. Prop 39 was passed in 2013 and funds from this 5year program must be spent by the summer of 2020. In 2017, Senate Bill #518 extended the program indefinitely and future funds will be allocated during the yearly State budget process. 12 SF Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) Because it serves as the District’s power and water utility, and because of its aggressive sustainability goals, the SFPUC has a keen interest in supporting the electrification of SFUSD buildings and supporting the deployment of solar PV across the portfolio. Thus, all but one of the District’s five rooftop solar power plants have been constructed by the SFPUC, and the agency is also exploring the installation of heat pumps to replace outdated gas or steam boiler systems. Other Sources The transition from gas-based heating to electric heat pumps is a major undertaking that will take substantial funds over the next two decades. It is therefore in the best interest of the District to diversify its funding stream for energy efficiency and fuel switch projects. Promising opportunities include: ● Energy Conservation Assistance Act (ECAA) Loans: These loans are available to school districts and other agencies to improve facilities and reduce energy usage. To date, San Francisco county has not availed itself of these funds. ● Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): These allow schools to install solar PV at no upfront cost because the project developer sells the power generated to the school district at a fixed rate that is typically lower than the local utility’s retail rate. Facilities The District has many opportunities to improve the carbon footprint of its buildings: BOND PROJECTS: voter-approved funding for new construction & major renovations provides the best opportunity for deep energy retrofits MONITORING: post-occupancy commissioning and energy monitoring can identify opportunities to adjust operation to meet design intent  OPERATIONS & SHARED SAVINGS: preventative maintenance, energy and water monitoring, and engagement of users prevent rising energy and water usage as buildings age FACILITIES PROJECTS: major repairs and deferred maintenance projects provide an opportunity to improve energy and water efficiency 13 In order to take advantage of each of these opportunities to affect the energy usage of the District’s buildings, the SFUSD Project Requirements have been created to assist design teams in supporting the District’s ambitious zero carbon goals. In summary: NEW BUILDINGS: New campuses and new buildings on an existing campus will be designed to achieve an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) < 20 kBTU/sf/yr. SFUSD’s preferred strategies for achieving such exemplary energy efficiency are outlined in the ZNE Guidelines at the end of this document. While the addition of renewable energy is generally outside the scope of new projects, solar readiness should be built into the building. BOND MODERNIZATIONS: Projects that are part of the 2016 Prop A Bond will incorporate improvements to the lighting systems and building envelope as outlined in ZNE Assessments commissioned by the District for every project prior to the design phase. These assessments will also look for opportunities to improve heating and ventilation systems, but these items will generally be tackled in future bonds unless failing equipment necessitates earlier action. FACILITIES PROJECTS: Projects managed by the Facilities Department generally have limited scope and will support ZNE goals by upgrading building elements as they wear out. In each case, the ZNE Guidelines below and District Design Standards + Guidelines (DDSG) will inform the design and selection of materials and/or equipment for these projects. RENEWABLES & STORAGE: Solar PV will be incorporated into projects as budgets allow. In a few years, as solar prices sink further, it will be financially prudent for SFUSD to become its own utility by generating electricity at costs below market rates. Furthermore, if the SFPUC’s electric rate shifts to a Time-of-Use structure, the District will begin to explore the possibility of installing batteries to absorb midday PV generation for later consumption. Beyond capital projects, SFUSD has numerous day-to-day opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of its building stock. MAINTENANCE & OPERATIONS: The District has many opportunities to reduce energy and water usage during the routine operations of its buildings. One issue in implementing these practices, however, is the fact that there are no staff specifically assigned to performing these tasks. Thus, the Sustainability Office has teamed up with Buildings & Grounds staff to make the necessary site visits, systems adjustments, or operational improvements. In this way, leaks are being fixed, thermostats are being reprogrammed to conserve energy, and potential capital projects are being identified and funded via Prop 39 or Facilities. EDUCATION & TRAINING: As capital and maintenance projects are implemented at SFUSD sites, it is important that site occupants are educated on how to operate their buildings in a way that supports the District’s sustainability goals. In fact, studies have shown that energy reductions greater than 20% can be generated through occupant engagement alone.  For this reason, the Sustainability Office makes occupant engagement throughout the facility cycle a key priority. User surveys help to identify comfort issues and improperly working heating systems, the Shared Savings Program (below) educates staff about energy efficient building operation, and soon-to14 be-developed ZNE trainings will help occupants of SFUSD’s most efficient buildings to enable their ambitious energy targets. SHARED SAVINGS: The Shared Savings behavioral energy reduction program focuses on decreasing natural gas, electricity, and water use in the district. Schools that sign up for the program identify a staff champion, who works with the District’s Conservation Manager to roll out behavior change campaigns as well as infrastructure fixes that reduce utility use. If a school reduces its utility bill by greater than 5% over baseline, the school receives 50% of the savings to spend as it sees fit. Regular feedback provides schools with positive reinforcement for good conservation behaviors and dissuades sites from wasting money and resources that could be allocated elsewhere.  Transportation Three types of vehicles comprise the District’s transportation footprint:  1. large, diesel-fueled school buses 2. small, gasoline-powered school buses 3. the District-owned fleet The first two are operated under contract with First Student, Inc. The last includes the cars, vans, and trucks stationed at the District’s maintenance yard (834 Toland St). Eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with all District-affiliated vehicles will therefore take a multi-pronged approach: DIESEL: Efforts are currently underway to switch the diesel vehicles over to renewable diesel, a fuel that is identical to its petroleum-based counterpart but cuts greenhouse gas emission by over 60%. Furthermore, because it contains fewer impurities, fleets that have made the switch report reduced filter maintenance. The City of San Francisco and San Jose Unified School District have both made the switch with good results and even some cost savings because of incentives under California’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS). While renewable diesel won’t be required until the District rebids its bus contract in 2020, the Sustainability Office is working with First Student to utilize the fuel much sooner. GASOLINE: A drop-in replacement fuel for gasoline is not currently available, so the District will await the development of a more robust market for small electric vans and buses before 15 mandating that First Student replace its current fleet as they go out of service in a decade or so. Of particular importance is the ability of these vehicles to handle the steep terrain that is common in San Francisco. FLEET: The vast majority of District-owned vehicles belong to the Buildings & Grounds and Custodial departments. Pick-up trucks, delivery and utility vans, and supervisor vehicles make up this fleet. Despite generous incentives from the State of California, electric vans still cost about twice the purchase price of a standard utility van. For this reason, SFUSD has decided to hold off on purchasing this type of vehicle at this time. However, thanks to a $10K rebate available only to public agencies, the purchase of an electric car is cost competitive with gasoline equivalents. That’s why the District’s Carbon Neutral Schools resolution requires that all new District cars be zero emissions vehicles.  Ultimately, the District would like to convert all vehicles to electric operation since electric vehicles are more cost-effective to run than their gasoline or diesel counterparts. As the price of electric vehicles drops quickly in the next few years, the up-front cost disparity to regular vehicles will no longer be a barrier to their widespread adoption.  16 CONCLUSION The San Francisco Unified School District is committed to leading the fight against climate change, both to inspire its students to take personal action as well as to reduce its utility and fuel costs so that more funding is available for the classroom. As it seeks to reduce its environmental footprint, the District knows that students will benefit through heathier learning environments, lower pollution levels around schools, and opportunities for curriculum and career integration. SFUSD efforts to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions complement and support existing efforts to minimize waste, connect students to nature, and promote active school commutes. They help to prepare students for the realities of a warming and resource-constrained 21st century world.  But SFUSD is only a tiny player in the fight against climate change. To really have an impact, the District must think beyond its own borders. That’s why the SFUSD Sustainability Office is engaging with the California State Architect, US Green Building Council, New Buildings Institute, and Department of Energy to widely sharing the details of its strategy with other districts at conferences and workshops. District staff are consulting with colleagues in other cities to ensure they benefit from the tools and resources developed for San Francisco Unified (and learns from them in return). And SFUSD is increasingly being recognized with awards and accolades for its pioneering efforts to implement its Carbon Reduction Plan.  Climate change may one day be remembered as the biggest challenge to face humans in the history of the species. But it will hopefully also be remembered as a challenge that was successfully overcome…one student and one district at a time.",0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,N/A

Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and Agricultural Code 13181)

Procedures

The Superintendent or designee shall designate a staff person to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM program that incorporates effective, least toxic pest management practices. The district's program shall include the following elements:

1. Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.

2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would indicate corrective action should be taken.

3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.

4. Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.

5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazard to people and the environment.

6. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained by a certified individual in the principles and practices of IPM. Those training records should be kept on file in a district designated office.

Procedures

The Superintendent or designee shall designate a staff person to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM program that incorporates effective, least toxic pest management practices. The district's program shall include the following elements:

Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.
 
Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would indicate corrective action should be taken.
 
Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.
 
Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.
 
Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazard to people and the environment.
 
Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained in the principles and practices of IPM.
 
Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and label directions registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.

Food gardening allows you to see, touch, smell and taste ""nutrition"". A garden is also an excellent way to learn about the nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables. Gardens can help you gain a better understanding and appreciation for the environment.

Gardens produce results you that can see, touch and taste. Children are eager to try the ""fruits"" of their labor. There is nothing like the taste of fresh and flavorful vegetables you have grown yourself!

Eat Your Vegetables! Research in children's food preferences indicates that simple exposure to a food will enhance willingness to try it. Familiarity tends to increase the perception that a food tastes good. Children also like to eat foods eaten by those they admire.

Parents find that children involved in gardening projects are more interested in nutrition and food labels. It is an excellent opportunity to help them understand the importance of eating different colored fruits and vegetables, and how they will help them to stay healthy.

Gardens come in different flavors. There are a lots of ways to start a garden and lots of different kinds of gardens you can start. There are raised bed gardens, greenhouse gardens, garden plots, and even container gardens. Container gardens can be as simple as a single pot, to planters, troughs, or wheel barrels. Plant some flowers too! You don't need much to start a garden!

Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and Agricultural Code 13181)

Procedures

The Superintendent or designee shall designate a staff person to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM program that incorporates effective, least toxic pest management practices. The district's program shall include the following elements:

1. Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.

2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would indicate corrective action should be taken.

3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.

4. Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.

5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazard to people and the environment.

6. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained in the principles and practices of IPM.

(cf. 4231 - Staff Development)

7. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and label directions registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.
